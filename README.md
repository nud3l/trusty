# trusty

We propose trusty, a system that allows arbitrary agents to lower their collateral in a wide range of protocols implemented on Ethereum. The decrease of collateral provides the same level of protection against economically rational adversaries as before. The decrease of collateral has a lower boundary at the expected opportunity cost of having the collateral locked in a given protocol. Agents need to continuously perform "desired actions" in a protocol to enjoy the lower collateral bounds.

## Protocol idea

The basic protocol idea is documented in this [overview](docs/trusty.md).

## Implementation

Work-in-progress.
